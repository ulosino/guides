# ULOSINO security

ULOSINO is commited to delivering a product of the 21st century, and that strategy involves a strong stance to security.

ULOSINO uses modern practices like CI, CD, and AI to detect vulnerabilities.

If you have discovered a vulnerability, contact ulosino@outlook.com. Be sure to include the affected service version, replication environment, full replication procedure, and general relation to the project (e.g. 'user'). Do not report any security concerns publically.

You should receive a response within a few business days. We'll work with you to deploy a patch.

All security reports, no matter how large or small, will be warmly welcomed.
