# Contribute to the ULOSINO Guides project

Firstly, a big thanks to you for setting aside your time to contribute! Your contributions will be warmly welcomed.

Remember that all contributions are bound by the Contribution Code of Conduct, available at CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

## Editing a single file

Often you'll want to update a single Guide page. Luckily this is easy - you don't even have to leave GitHub!

First, go into the OS file store, available in `/public/content/browse/`. Then find the file you want and open it.

When you open a file, it'll show something like this:

```
---
# Required metadata
title: "File Managers"
description: "Learn about file managers"
---

The file manager is a piece of software...
```

We want to edit this file.

- Select the pencil button to open the edit view;
- Make your edits, and;
- Then go to the bottom of the page and select the green 'Commit Changes' button. That's it.

## Larger contributions

If you want to contribute to the Source Code of ULOSINO Guides, or make mutiple changes to Database Content, you'll need to make a repository fork so that you can work with the stack on your computer.

Below is a recommended way to do this. There are other ways to do the same thing.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local system.
2. Open the terminal and create your new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Finalise by compiling a production build:

   ```
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

6. If you're making a large edit, be sure to run our tests (in a different terminal window with `npm run start` running):

   ```
   npx cypress open

   # Fallback:
   npx cypress run
   ```

7. If the build passes, you can proceed to make create a pull request for your fork!

Note these guidelines when making pull requests:

- Make your commit comment as descriptive as possible. Include as much information as you can. Explain anything that the file differentials wonâ€™t make apparent.
- Make sure the relevant labels are used. In most cases this means applying a contribution 'area' (with 'Source', 'Database Content', or 'Backend') and a 'type' (like 'Bug').

## Issues and bugs

We recommend using GitHub issues to report bugs and discuss features.

> **Tip:** Before creating an issue, be sure to search and check if it already exists. If there is already an issue, give it a like!

If you do need to create your own issue to report a bug, be sure to include the following:

- Your environment (operating system, system details)
- Steps to reproduce
- Message(s) or error(s) you get in the console, if you do. Include a screenshot or full copy of this output.

For all issues, remember to use labels and try to be as descriptive as possible (even what you might dismiss).
