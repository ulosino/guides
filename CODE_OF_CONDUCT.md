# Contribution Code of Conduct

## Overview

The team at ULOSINO ('ULOSINO', 'we') engages with the community to collectively build the ULOSINO web service ('the project').

Those contributing to the project are a combination of professionals, employees, volunteers, and students (collectively; 'community members'). These community members come from all walks of life and have an assortment of roles and responsibilities when collaborating to create a better version of the project.

All contributors should keep the following guidelines in mind. This list is not exhaustive:

- Be welcoming and patient at all times;
- Be respectful and inclusive, and;
- Act professionally in all community spaces.

Always keep in mind that:

- While disagreements and conflict can occur, they are not an excuse for poor behaviour, and;
- Not all community members will understand slang, colloquialisms, and euphemisms that you understand. Sexist, racist, or other exclusionary comments are unacceptable.

## Unacceptable behaviour

Harassment and other exlusionary behaviours are not permitted and include, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another community member;
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory language;
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material;
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information;
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms, and including persistent misuse of pronouns;
- Unwelcome sexual attention and/or suggestive language;
- Harassment of other community members, and any physical violence or intimidation, threatened and/or acted on, and;
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Inclusion

It is not acceptable to make assumptions based on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, or disability.

It's best to use gender-neutral terms and greetings to refer to groups of people. Making the wrong assumption about the gender identity of a community member can be considered offensive, and if persistent, unacceptable.

If you have made discriminatory comments, or misgendered a community member, it is important to remain professional, correct yourself, and apologise.
